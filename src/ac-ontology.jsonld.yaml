  The Audio Commons Ontology provides classes and properties for
  describing audio content, both musical and non-musical, on the Semantic Web.
  It is a specialisation of a bibliographic model called [Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records).
  Furthermore, it contains the generalisation of some concepts from the [Music Ontology](http://musicontology.com/).

  The Audio Commons Ontology has been created in the context of the European project [Audio Commons](https://www.audiocommons.org/),
  which were aimed at favouring sharing and reuse of audio content (both of musical and non-musical nature), specially using [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) licenses.


  It is designed specifically to integrate access to multiple heterogeneously structured audio content providers.
  In particular the following ones have been considered in the project:

  - [Freesound](https://freesound.org/), a collaborative database of Creative Commons Licensed sounds;

  - [Jamendo](https://www.jamendo.com/), a music website for independent artists;

  - [Europeana Sounds](https://www.eusounds.eu/), a European project collecting and sharing data from several archives of sounds and sound-related media;

  - [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), a non-profit library of millions of freely accessible media contents.


  ### The base model

  <center>
  ![A diagram showing the entities Work, Expression, Manifestation, Item](./img/FRBR-Group-1-entities-and-basic-relations.svg.png)
  </center>

  The Audio Commons ontology is based on [Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records (FRBR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_Requirements_for_Bibliographic_Records),
  a bibliographic model designed for user tasks of retrieval and access in online library catalogues and bibliographic databases.
  FRBR distinguish the products of intellectual or artistic endeavor in four main classes: work, expression, manifestation, item.
  It is available as RDF vocabulary at https://vocab.org/frbr/core.
  For further information on FRBR, check the [standard](https://repository.ifla.org/handle/123456789/811).


  Another important model related to audio is the [Music Ontology](http://musicontology.com/), which is also based on the FRBR model.
  Our ontology is more generic than the Music Ontology but is interoperable with it to support the specificities of music-related audio content.


  The Audio Commons ontology works also in conjunction with

  - [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/dcmi-terms/) for basic metadata,

  - [EBU Core](https://www.ebu.ch/metadata/ontologies/ebucore/) for technical properties of audio files,

  - [SKOS](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/) to support taxonomic classifications,

  - [Creative Commons Licensing schema](https://creativecommons.org/ns) to represent media licensing,

  - [Event ontology](http://motools.sf.net/event/event.html) for the formalisation of events,

  - [Audio Features Ontology](https://w3id.org/afo/onto/) for the characterisation of audio features.


  ### Ontology overview
  

  ![A diagram showing the main classes of the Audio Commons ontology](./img/AC-Ontology-Skeleton.png)


  The figure above shows the most general classes and properties of the Audio Commons ontology and their relationship with classes of the FRBR and the Music Ontology:
  
  - [`ac:AudioExpression`](https://w3id.org/ac-ontology/aco#AudioExpression), the specific intellectual or artistic form that a work takes each time it is _realised_, in the audio domain, e.g., the recording or synthesis of music or sounds;
  
  - [`ac:AudioManifestation`](#AudioManifestation), the physical embodiment of an audio expression, e.g., a musical track, a sound, an album; 
  
  - [`ac:AudioItem`](#AudioItem), a single exemplar of an audio manifestation, e.g., a copy of a CD or a specific media file.


  The FRBR class Work, representing a distinct intellectual or artistic creation on a more conceptual level, has not been specialised in Audio Commons.


  The Audio Commons ontology provides a generic schema for audio classification through the property [`ac:audioCategory`](#audioCategory)
  that associates any audio expression, manifestation, or item to some generic [`ac:AudioCategory`](#AudioCategory).
  These two terms can be specialised to provide spefic categorisations.


  ### Manifestations: audio clips and collections


  ![A diagram showing the main classes of the Audio Commons ontology](./img/AC-Ontology-Manifestation.png)
  
  
  The figure above shows classes and properties related to audio manifestations.
  An instance of [`ac:AudioClip`](#AudioClip), a subclass of `ac:AudioManifestation`,
  is any audio segment that has been published in some form or uploaded for consumption, for example, a track in a music label's repository or a sound in an audio repository, library or archive.


  The class [`ac:AudioCollection`](#AudioCollection), another subclass of `ac:AudioManifestation`, is used to represent collections of audio clips.
  The class [`ac:AudioCollectionNode`](#AudioCollectionNode) is used to represent single nodes of a collection, offering local information like the index in the collection and pointers to previous and next nodes.
  The separation between the collection node and its actual content (e.g., an `ac:AudioClip`) permits the same content to be shared in multiple collections.


  The content of each node of a collection is not limited to an `ac:AudioClip`, but may contain any `ac:AudioManifestation`.
  Collections can thus contain other collections to support specific cases, e.g. a mapping to the Music Ontology model where an `mo:Release` can contain multiple `mo:Record`(s) that can in turn contain multiple `mo:Track`(s).

  ### Items: audio files

  ![A diagram showing ac:Item class and related class and properties](./img/AC-Ontology-Item.png)
  
  
  An `ac:AudioItem` is a concrete exemplar of an audio manifestation.
  In our domain, the main exemplars are the actual audio files. 


  The corresponding class [`ac:AudioFile`](#AudioItem) is a subclass of `ac:AudioItem`.
  It is subclass of `ebu:MediaResource` too and the corresponging properties of EBU Core can be used to describe the file
  (e.g., `ebu:hasEncodingFormat`, `ebu:fileSize`).


  ### Expressions: audio signals

  ![A diagram showing ac:Expression class and related class and properties](./img/AC-Ontology-Expression.png)
  

  While `ac:AudioFile` represents a concrete file encoded in
  a certain format, [`ac:DigitalSignal`](#DigitalSignal) is the representation of the corresponding digital signal.
  `ac:DigitalSignal` is a subclass of `ac:MusicalExpression`. 


  The data properties `ac:sampleRate`, `ac:bitsPerSample`, and `ac:channels`,
  associate a signal with its basic features specific to digital representations.


  The property `ac:publicationOf` can be used to associate an `ac:AudioClip` with the corresponding digital signal.
  The property `ac:encodes` instead, associates an `ac:AudioFile` with the encoded digital signal.


  ### Events: recording/syntesis

  ![A diagram showing ac:SignalProduction class and related class and properties!](./img/AC-Ontology-SignalProduction.png)
  

  The description of temporal events is crucial to formalise and document transitions in the workflow of audio production and publication.
  The class `event:Event` of the Event Ontology is thus specialised for specific actions that are interesting for the audio domain.
  
  
  Using the `event:Event` class, details of an event such as its location in time and space, its factor and its products may be explicitly described.
  Moreover, events can be composed using the property `event:sub_event`, to build complex events.


  The class `ac:SignalProduction` represents the act of producing a `ac:Signal`, which could be either an `ac:AnalogSignal` or a `ac:DigitalSignal`.
  This is complemented by `ac:Recording`, representing the process of recording a sound (`ac:Sound`) or the product of `ac:Synthesis`, in case of artificially generated sounds. 


  ### Events (continued): publication

  ![A diagram showing ac:Publication class and related class and properties!](./img/AC-Ontology-Publication.png)
  

  The event `ac:AudioPublication` represents the public release of a piece of work, e.g., the release of a new album by a band.


  ### Usage Example

  ![A diagram showing an example of ontology usage!](./img/AC_Example-AudioClip.png)


  The figure above shows an example of use of the Audio Commons ontology to represent a sound from the Freesound database.
  For simplicity only the classes `ac:AudioClip`, `ac:AudioFile`, and `ac:AudioCategory` are used in this case.
